### Background

- The Ad Campaign Analytics Dashboard is a data science project aimed at providing insights into the performance of a particular ad campaign. The project leverages data from a 42-day campaign and provides key metrics such as impressions, clicks, video starts, and video completions, among others.
- The main objective of this project is to help marketing teams optimize their ad campaigns by identifying the best-performing segments and trends. By doing so, they can improve their return on investment (ROI) and achieve better campaign results.
- The project uses a combination of Excel and Python to analyze the data and visualize the results in an interactive dashboard. This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and uncovering key insights.
- Through this project, we hope to demonstrate the power of data analytics in improving ad campaign performance and provide a framework for other marketing teams to use in their own campaigns.

### Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. You can install these libraries using pip:

```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Usage

To use this project, simply run the Jupyter notebook dental-analytics.ipynb. This notebook contains all the code for loading and analyzing the data, as well as generating visualizations.

### Files

1. Ad-Insights-Dashboard.xlsx: This is an Excel dashboard file. It contains visualizations, charts and reports that can help in analyzing the ad campaign data and gaining insights from it.

2. ad_campaign_analytics.ipynb: This is a Jupyter Notebook file that contains the Python code for the analysis of the ad campaign data. The notebook is divided into different sections based on the analysis performed on the data. The sections may include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and statistical analysis. This notebook will help in replicating the analysis and generating new insights from the ad campaign data.

### Data

- The data used in this project has 37448 rows and 15 columns for ad campaign analytics is a collection of advertising data for a campaign that ran for 42 days. The data contains information about ad impressions, clicks, and video interactions for various ad segments. The dataset also includes information about the creative categories, media, operating systems, and site categories associated with each ad segment.
- There are a total of 2603 unique impressions and 79 clicks received during the campaign, with 70 different types of creative IDs and 40 creatives grouped under 9 creative categories. The data also includes information about 6 color categories for the creatives, 2 types each for media and creative format, and 3 types for the operating systems.
- The data provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of the ad campaign, which is useful for understanding which segments performed best and which ones could be improved in future campaigns. Through the analysis of this data, insights about the best and worst performing segments, interesting trends, and recommendations for future campaigns can be made. 

Here is a brief description of the data:

### Methodology

The methodology used in this project involves a combination of data exploration, data preprocessing, and data analysis techniques.

- First, we explored the dataset to gain a better understanding of its structure, variables, and possible relationships between them. We visualized the data using various plots and charts, including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
- After preprocessing the data, we conducted an in-depth analysis using statistical and machine learning techniques to uncover insights and patterns in the data. We used Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn to implement the analysis.

Finally, we summarized our findings and insights in the form of visualizations, tables, and charts. These insights can be used to make data-driven decisions and improve the effectiveness of ad campaigns.
